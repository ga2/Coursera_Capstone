# Coursera_Capstone
First Coursera capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate:
for pure fun I imagined a recommender system that predicts the most suitable place for a gym in a cold business start in the city of Bari (Italy), among the "for rent" estates available in the various neighborhoods, with the assumption that the most attractive places are the ones surrounded by particular Point of Interests / venues.

The system uses the Foursquare API and webscrapping to get data and supervised machine learning techniques to learn from the other cities situation.

Although the small dataset couldn't provide the best accuracy scores, I'm sharing it with the idea that these kinds of models can be improved for the future and be thought as the small brick that can help medium and small cities to maintain the local economy fed by small seller/services businesses.
